    "## **Abstract**\n",
    "This paper investigates the Lorenz system, a set of nonlinear differential equations that serve as a foundational model in the study of dynamical systems. Beginning with a discussion of the system's mathematical formulation and its physical origins in fluid convection, we explore the behavior of the system under varying parameter conditions. Through numerical simulations, we analyze key features such as equilibrium points, stability, and bifurcation phenomena, which reveal the system's transition between different dynamic regimes. Special attention is given to the emergence of chaos, highlighting the system's sensitivity to initial conditions and the underlying mechanisms that lead to unpredictable behavior. The study is supported by a series of plots and animations that visualize the system's trajectories, bifurcation diagrams, and phase space dynamics. These results provide both qualitative and quantitative insights into the Lorenz system, demonstrating its role as a rich and instructive example of nonlinear dynamics and chaos theory."

    "## **Introduction**\n",
    "The Lorenz system, introduced by Edward Lorenz in the 1960s, is a set of three coupled, nonlinear ordinary differential equations that model simplified fluid convection. Originally developed to study atmospheric processes, the system has since become a fundamental example in the study of nonlinear dynamics. It demonstrates how deterministic systems can exhibit complex and unexpected behavior over time. By examining the interplay of its variables, the Lorenz system offers insight into the sensitivity of dynamical systems to initial conditions and the broader implications for predicting physical phenomena in nature. This paper explores the mathematical formulation, key properties, and behavior of the Lorenz system, shedding light on its significance in the study of dynamical systems. \n",
    "#### The equations governing the Lorenz system are: \n",
    " $$\\begin{cases} \\dot{x}​=σ(y−x), \\\\ \\dot{y}=x(ρ−z)−y, \\\\ \\dot{z}=xy−βz. \\end{cases}$$ \n",
    " Here $x$, $y$, and $z$ represent the system's state variables, and $\\sigma$, $\\rho$, and $\\beta$ are real positive parameters. Typically, $\\sigma$ represents the Prandtl number, $\\rho$ is the Rayleigh number, and $\\beta$ is a geometric factor."

    "We can quite clearly see that although the error was not significant at all (a mere 0.1%), it nonetheless had a substantial effect on the behavior and evolution of the system. This is a key feature of deterministic chaotic systems: the smallest changes in initial conditions lead to dramatically different outcomes. The 'deterministic' part means that although the system seems to exhibit random and aperiodic behavior, the path that the system will take, given the same initial conditions, will always stay the same.\n",

    "The animation below demonstrates how little changes in initial conditions can lead to vastly different trajectories. The 3 trajectories start off very close to each other, but quickly diverge and end up in completely different regions of phase space. This is a hallmark of chaotic systems and is known as the butterfly effect. The initial conditions are as follows: \n",
